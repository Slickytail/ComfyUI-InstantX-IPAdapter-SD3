# ComfyUI-IPAdapter-SD3

ComfyUI implementation of the [InstantX IP-Adapter for SD3.5 Large](https://huggingface.co/InstantX/SD3.5-Large-IP-Adapter).

## Installation

Download [`ip-adapter.bin` from the original repository](https://huggingface.co/InstantX/SD3.5-Large-IP-Adapter/blob/main/ip-adapter.bin), and place it in the `models/ipadapter` folder of your ComfyUI installation. (I suggest renaming it to something easier to remember).

Download [`siglip_vision_patch14_384.safetensors` from ComfyUI's rehost](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/sigclip_vision_384) and place it in the `models/clip_vision` folder.  
The original model was trained on [google/siglip-400m-patch14-384](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384). To be honest, I'm not sure where the comfy rehost model comes from, but it gives very similar results: so I suspect that it's a slightly modified version of the original google model.

## Usage
The IP-Adapter can be used with **Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large** and **Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo**.  
Please note that the model was originally trained on SD3.5 Large, and so the accuracy of the adapter is not as good when using the Turbo model.  
An example workflow can be found in the `workflows` directory.

I recommend using an image weight of 0.5.

## TODOs
- Allow multiple adapters to be added together and not overwrite each other.
- Replace hardcoded parameters (such as hidden size/num layers) with values determined from the model. Would allow the same code to be used for future adapters, e.g. for SD3.5 Medium.
- Convert the adapter to safetensors.
